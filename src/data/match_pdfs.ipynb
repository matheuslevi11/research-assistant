Introduction\\nThe rapid growth in deep learning research for face recognition \\nand emotion analysis has underscored the critical need for diverse \\nand comprehensive datasets to train robust and high-performing mod-\\nels [1–5]. However, as privacy concerns over real-world facial data \\nincrease, the priority has shifted to finding alternative approaches. \\nSynthetic face generation has emerged as a cutting-edge data augmen-\\ntation technique [6,7], creating large, diverse datasets. These synthetic \\ndatasets provide the development of robust facial images without re-\\nlying on real-world sensitive data [8]. Despite these advancements, \\nthe challenge of obtaining high-quality annotated data that accurately \\nrepresents a wide range of ethnicities and diverse expressions re-\\nmains [9]. This limitation prevents synthetic datasets from fully solving \\nthe problem.\\nGenerative modeling has significantly advanced data synthesis, \\nstarting with variational autoencoders (VAE) [10,11], followed by \\n∗Corresponding author.\\nE-mail address: flowice@ustc.edu.cn (B.

GANs excelled in generating large datasets while ensuring \\nprivacy [16,17], offering fine-grained control over attributes like pose \\nand expression [18–20]. However, challenges remain in providing \\ncontrol over multi-domain data (e.g., text, audio, video), emphasizing \\nthe need for further innovation.\\nDiffusion models [21–23] have emerged as a superior alternative to \\nGANs, demonstrating remarkable flexibility in diverse generation tasks. \\nThey excel in uni-modal image-to-image applications, including image \\nediting [24] and inpainting [25], as well as in cross-modal tasks such \\nas high-quality text-to-image [26,27], audio-to-image [28], audio-to-\\nvideo [29], and image-to-text applications like image-to-caption gen-\\neration [30]. Building on this versatility, diffusion models enable ad-\\nvanced multi-modal applications, particularly subject-driven content \\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.inffus.2025.103431\\nReceived 19 February 2025; Received in revised form 11 May 2025; Accepted 15 June 2025\\nInformation Fusion 125 (2026) 103431 \\nAvailable online 4 July 2025 \\n1566-2535/© 2025 Elsevier B.V.

Further expanding on these advances, diffusion mod-\\nels offer significant potential for personalized text-to-image genera-\\ntion [32–34], where a set of input images is used to perform user-\\ndefined modifications, achieving enhanced customization in image syn-\\nthesis.\\nDespite advances in personalized text-to-image generation, the chal-\\nlenge of modifying facial expressions without compromising identity, \\nremains largely underexplored. Existing standalone diffusion-based per-\\nsonalization methods [31,32,34] prioritize subject identity preserva-\\ntion but lack facial expression modification. While some approaches \\nhave explored semantic control in personalized generation, they ad-\\ndress distinct challenges rather than directly targeting facial expression \\ngeneration. For instance, [35] proposes a general disentanglement \\nframework without specializing in expressions; [36] improves temporal \\nconsistency but lacks semantic flexibility; [37] emphasizes identity \\npreservation via linear embeddings, and [38] mitigates identity drift \\nthrough gradient-based fine-tuning without targeting facial expressions. \\nNone of these approaches explicitly tackle facial expression generation.\\nIn response to the limitations of standalone approaches, hybrid \\nmethods, [39–42] have emerged, combining pre-trained text-to-image \\ndiffusion models with external modules, such as face/expression recog-\\nnition models and custom-trained embedding extractors, to enable \\nprecise manipulation of facial attributes. While representing the cur-\\nrent state-of-the-art in expression generation, these hybrid techniques \\nintroduce several critical constraints that limit their practical adop-\\ntion. First, they require large-scale datasets for fine-tuning to align \\nthe external modules with the pre-trained text-to-image model. Sec-\\nond, their integration incurs significant computational overhead due \\nto joint fine-tuning of auxiliary and base models. More importantly, \\nthese hybrid approaches often suffer from feature misalignment, where \\nexternal embeddings conflict with the domain of the pretrained text-to-\\nimage model due to the different training objectives. This misalignment \\ndegrades output quality, either through artifacts or by compromising \\nthe preservation of identity.\\nIn response to the challenges outlined above and motivated by the \\nlimitations in existing methods, we have identified and pursued the \\nfollowing research questions in this paper:\\n• RQ1: How can a diffusion-based framework be developed for \\naccurate facial expression generation that avoids external em-\\nbeddings and overcomes challenges like large datasets, feature \\nmisalignment, and high computational cost?\\n• RQ2: How can semantic attributes be effectively modified using \\na standalone diffusion-based models to synthesize accurate facial \\nexpressions, while maintaining identity?\\n• RQ3: How can the connection between expressive fused iden-\\ntity and expression prompt be effectively established to reduce \\nlanguage ambiguities, enhance expression intensity, and how can \\nfeature alignment be further strengthened?\\nTaking these research questions into consideration, the key contribu-\\ntions of our work are:\\n• We propose FaceExpr, an innovative identity-specific fine-tune, \\nthree-instance framework based solely on standalone diffusion \\nmodels, without external embeddings. It synthesizes expressive \\nfacial images of identity on a textual prompt across diverse en-\\nvironments (addressing RQ1).\\n• To achieve precise alignment of identity and expression features, \\nwe introduce a novel intermediate feature fusion technique us-\\ning an attention mechanism within the U-Net denoising module \\n(addressing RQ2).\\n• To mitigate potential language discrepancies and enhance ex-\\npression intensity, we introduce expression text prompt em-\\nbeddings within the U-Net denoising module. Furthermore, we \\nemploy expression crafting loss to strengthen the alignment of the \\nfeatures (addressing RQ3).\\n• Our method achieves optimized performance with a focus on \\ncomputational efficiency, identity preservation, and expression \\naccuracy, offering a balance between complexity and resource \\nutilization.\\nIn summary, FaceExpr is the first innovative three-instance frame-\\nwork that achieves accurate and semantically rich facial expression \\nsynthesis built on standalone diffusion models, eliminating reliance on \\nexternal components like GANs, VAEs, or facial expression recognition \\nmodules. The framework leverages three instances of a pretrained \\ntext-to-image diffusion model: one for expression guidance via feature \\nextraction, a second for feature fusion through a novel attention mecha-\\nnism, and a third to leverage the capabilities of pretrained text-to-image \\nmodels by using prior preservation loss. The proposed FaceExpr frame-\\nwork enables controllable synthesis of high-fidelity, identity-preserving \\nexpressive faces with diverse facial attributes, accessories, actions, and \\nbackground scenes without the need for large-scale datasets or exten-\\nsive fine-tuning, thereby significantly reducing computational time (for \\nan overview of FaceExpr’s synthesis capabilities, see Fig. 1).\\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview \\nof related work. Section 3 discusses the preliminaries of denoising \\ndiffusion models and text-to-image generation. Section 4 presents the \\nproposed approach. Section 5 covers implementation details, experi-\\nmental setup, and results. Section 6 compares the proposed approach \\nwith both standalone and hybrid models, using performance metrics \\nand insights from user feedback studies. Furthermore, ablation studies \\nare performed to evaluate the influence of each component and in-\\nstance. Section 7 summarizes the work and suggests avenues for further \\nresearch.\\n2. Related work\\nThis section reviews recent developments in personalized text-to-\\nimage generation and facial expression synthesis, highlighting key \\nlimitations that motivate our method. We categorize prior work into \\ntwo broad paradigms: (1) standalone methods, which rely solely on \\ndiffusion-based approach, and (2) hybrid methods, which incorporate \\nexternal modules or embeddings. Our method follows the standalone \\nparadigm, utilizing end-to-end diffusion framework without auxiliary \\nnetworks or external guidance.\\nWe analyze existing methods across three dimensions: (1) the core \\ntechnique, (2) architectural design (e.g., single, dual, or multi-instance), \\nand (3) explicit expression control. A comparative summary is provided \\nin Table 1. This structured comparison offers an in-depth analysis \\nof each approach and provides a clear basis for distinguishing our \\nframework, both architecturally and functionally, from prior methods.\\n2.1. Personalized text-to-image generation\\nPersonalized text-to-image generation aims to synthesize images \\nthat retain the subject’s identity while adapting to user-defined contex-\\ntual settings, such as background, scenes, and lighting conditions [32–\\n38,43–45]. A key objective in this field is maintaining optimal identity \\npreservation while avoiding unintended alterations to irrelevant details \\nthat could compromise the subject’s identity. Many existing approaches \\ntightly couple identity with semantic attributes, which limits the ability \\nto modify specific attributes such as facial expressions without causing \\nidentity drift [46].\\nSeveral techniques have been developed to achieve effective person-\\nalization using pre-trained text-to-image models. The seminal work of \\nTextual Inversion [31] introduced pseudo-tokens for concept learning \\nbut suffered from limited identity fidelity due to their low-dimensional \\nrepresentations. DreamBooth [32] addressed this through full model \\nfine-tuning, linking the subject’s identity to a unique identifier and \\nembedding it into latent space. However, these approaches primarily \\nfocus on the provided subject’s identity preservation and do not allow \\nInformation Fusion 125 (2026) 103431 \\n2 \\nM.S. Afgan et al.\\nFig. 1.

However, \\nthey fall short in specializing this disentanglement toward expression \\ncontrol, often treating expressions as a subset of broader attribute ma-\\nnipulation. Similarly, CelebBasis [37] uses linear identity embeddings \\nfor efficient identity transfer, but struggles with semantic flexibility \\nand expression-specific variation due to its reliance on single-image \\nencoding. CIP-TIG [38] tackled the tension between identity preser-\\nvation and attribute modification using a cross-initialization scheme \\nduring fine-tuning. While effective in mitigating identity degradation, \\nthis approach still treats expression generation as incidental, not a \\nprimary goal.\\nUnlike the above standalone methods, our proposed approach ex-\\nplicitly targets facial expression generation in personalized settings, \\na challenge often neglected or indirectly addressed in prior work. \\nWe introduce two core innovations that distinguish our method from \\nprevious standalone frameworks: a three-instance architecture (Sec-\\ntion 4), an attention-based feature fusion mechanism within the U-Net \\n(Section 4.2.1). These contributions allow us to achieve a more nuanced \\nbalance between identity preservation and expression. Our method, \\nFaceExpr, generates expressive variations of a subject while preserving \\ncritical identity details. A comparative summary is provided in Table 1, \\nwhich outlines the design and approach of each method, highlighting \\nthe distinguishing features of our framework.\\n2.2. Face expression generation\\nFacial expression generation using GANs has shown promising re-\\nsults [47–50]. However, these methods often lack efficient textual \\ncontrol, limiting their flexibility and adaptability. In contrast, diffusion \\nmodels have emerged as a powerful alternative, enabling text-guided \\nimage generation [51] and offering greater versatility. This capability \\nopens up new possibilities for the controlled generation of expressive \\nfaces through textual input.\\nRecently, hybrid approaches have emerged that combine pre-trained \\ntext-to-image models with additional pre-trained learned embeddings \\nfor facial expression generation. For instance, DiffSFSR [39] utilizes \\nrecognition models like ArcFace [52], FaceNet [53], and DLib [54]\\nto extract identity-related embeddings, and DLN [55] to extract\\nexpression-related embeddings. It then uses a multi-layer perceptron \\nnetwork to provide conditional control to the pre-trained text-to-\\nimage model. Similarly, EmojiDiff [40] trains an additional refiner \\nfrom scratch to guide expressions using same-identity triplet data, \\nenabling expression transfer. The W + adapter [41] extends the latent \\nspace of StyleGAN to leverage embeddings for expression guidance. \\nMasterWeaver [42] employs a CLIP image encoder to extract reference \\nface features, aligning the editing direction of expression control with \\nthe text-to-image model.\\nHowever, relying on external pre-trained models presents significant \\nchallenges: (1) high computational costs for embedding extraction from \\nexternal modules, (2) the need for embedding pre-processing to ensure \\nInformation Fusion 125 (2026) 103431 \\n3 \\nM.S. Afgan et al.\\narchitectural alignment, (3) the requirement for large-scale datasets \\nto enable intensive fine-tuning for multi-objective optimization, and \\n(4) prolonged training times for feature alignment [56], as the base \\nmodel was not originally optimized for these external embeddings. \\nMoreover, such embeddings often further degrade output fidelity, as \\ntheir latent space is misaligned with the text-to-image model’s native \\nrepresentation.\\nIn contrast, FaceExpr offers a more efficient and streamlined solu-\\ntion by eliminating the need for external embeddings, as highlighted \\nin Table 1. By introducing a self-contained diffusion-based framework \\nwhere feature fusion occurs internally, FaceExpr addresses all key chal-\\nlenges associated with external embeddings. Furthermore, by operating \\nwithin the native representation space of the diffusion model, it avoids \\nfidelity degradation caused by latent space mismatches. This design not \\nonly enhances computational efficiency but also ensures the generation \\nof accurate, identity-preserving, and expressive facial images.\\n3. Preliminaries\\nIn this section, we provide a brief overview of the foundational \\nknowledge discussed in this paper. Section 3.1 introduces the denois-\\ning diffusion models. Section 3.2 presents the U-Net architecture of \\ntext-to-image models.\\n3.1. Denoising diffusion model\\nDiffusion models are inspired by systematically adding progres-\\nsive noise, utilizing Markov Chain state transitions [57], and drawing \\ninsights from non-equilibrium statistical physics [58]. This approach \\nestablishes a robust and adaptable framework for comprehensively \\nanalyzing distributions. Moreover, it leverages the intrinsic connection \\nbetween diffusion probabilistic models and denoising score matching \\nvia Langevin Dynamics [59] to be utilized for data synthesis [21,22]. \\nThese models operate by introducing a forward and reverse process, \\nwith the forward process progressively adding Gaussian noise, while \\nthe reverse process denoises the data.\\nIn more detail, diffusion models are latent models characterized by \\nconditional probability densities [21]. The latent representation 𝑧0 ∼\\n𝑞(𝑧0) corresponds to the data, and 𝑡 represents the time steps in the \\nforward and reverse processes. In the forward process, Gaussian noise \\nwith mean \\n√\\n1 −𝛽𝑡𝑧𝑡−1 and variance 𝛽𝑡𝐼 is added to the data, with \\n𝛽𝑡 being either learned or set as a constant [10]. The reverse process \\nutilizes a learnable mean 𝝁𝜃 for denoising, and KL divergence is used to \\ncompare Gaussians to optimize the model. This design ultimately aims \\nto minimize the negative log-likelihood, facilitating the generation of \\nhigh-quality samples [21].\\nThe objective function is: \\n𝐿DM(𝜃) ∶= E𝑡,𝐳0,𝝐∼\\ue23a(𝟎,𝐈)\\n[\\n‖‖‖𝜖−𝜖𝜃\\n(𝐳𝑡, 𝑡)‖‖‖\\n2]\\n,\\n(1)\\nwhere 𝐿DM(𝜃) is the MSE between the actual noise 𝜖 and the predicted \\nnoise 𝜖𝜃(𝐳𝑡, 𝑡) at time step 𝑡, which the model minimizes.\\nFurthermore, diffusion models have been extended to incorporate \\nexternal conditions such as text [60], segmentation masks [61], or \\n3D mappings [62], which guide the diffusion process to synthesize \\nconditional data. The Stable Diffusion model [26] is one of the state-\\nof-the-art (SOTA) models that generate high-quality visual images from \\ntext descriptions.\\n3.2. U-Net architecture of text-to-image\\nThe architecture of Stable Diffusion consists of an encoder, a de-\\ncoder, and an additional denoising U-Net module. These components \\ncollaborate to produce detailed and accurate image generations condi-\\ntioned on textual prompts. The U-Net module operates through down-\\nsampling and upsampling stages, which are integral to the diffusion \\nprocess. The stages of the diffusion U-Net can be described as follows: \\n𝑋𝑃\\n𝑡∈[𝑇,0] = 𝑈Net-E𝜙(↓(𝑅Net\\n(𝐶atn(𝑋), 𝐸𝑃\\nemb\\n) , 𝑡emb\\n))\\n(2)\\n𝑌𝑃\\n𝑡∈[𝑇,0] = 𝑈Net-D𝜙(↑(𝑅Net\\n(𝐶atn(𝑋𝑡), 𝐸𝑃\\nemb\\n) , 𝑡emb\\n))\\n(3)\\nwhere 𝑋𝑃\\n𝑡∈[𝑇,0] represents the downsampled features while denoising at \\ntime step 𝑡 of the encoder 𝐸𝜙 in the U-Net module [63]. Each step \\ninvolves four downsampling operations, preceded by the embedding of \\nan external conditional prompt 𝐸𝑃\\n𝑒𝑚𝑏 integrated through cross-attention \\n𝐶atn and a Residual Network 𝑅Net block. Subsequently, the decoder \\n𝐷𝜙 applies the same structure in an upsampling manner, with 𝑌𝑃\\n𝑡∈[𝑇,0]\\nrepresenting the upsampled features. Our approach builds upon this by \\nextracting expression-specific semantic features from the U-Net residual \\nblock during denoising. These features are fused with additional prompt \\nembeddings to fine-tune a second instance of the model.\\n4. Proposed framework\\nAs illustrated in Fig. 2, we introduce FaceExpr, an innovative \\nthree-instance framework specifically designed to tackle the task of \\nidentity-preserving facial expression generation in diverse, user-defined \\ncontextual settings, all driven solely by textual conditions. FaceExpr is \\ndesigned to coordinate three dedicated instances of pretrained text-to-\\nimage diffusion models, each assigned to a distinct and complementary \\nsubtask.\\nFramework Workflow: Instance 1: Expression Guider generates \\nexpressive faces conditioned on an expression prompt 𝑃(exp), extract-\\ning intermediate spatial features that guide the subsequent instance, \\nas detailed in Section 4.1.1. Instance 2: Personalized Expression \\nGenerator (PEG) is the cornerstone of our framework, fine-tune the \\nmodel instance using input identity images paired with a text prompt \\n𝑃(id), which contains a unique identifier [xyz*] and the subject’s class \\n(e.g., ‘‘man/woman’’). Specifically, by incorporating our novel feature \\nfusion mechanism, which dynamically aligns expression features (from \\nInstance 1) with identity features, as described in Section 4.2.1, and\\nAdditional Prompt Embedding, which integrates expression-specific \\nembeddings, enabling a connection with the expressive, fused iden-\\ntity as outlined in Section 4.2.2. Additionally, it employs triple-loss \\noptimization, which jointly optimizes identity preservation, expression \\ncrafting loss to strengthen the feature alignment, and prior preserva-\\ntion loss to retain the prior knowledge. Instance 3: Context Guider\\nprovides the prior knowledge needed to integrate context using the text \\nprompt 𝑃(context), addressing the limitation of catastrophic forgetting \\nduring fine-tuning as discussed in Section 4.3.\\n4.1. Instance 1: Expression guidance\\nThis sub-section outlines the methodology for expression guidance \\nin our framework. Section 4.1.1 provides details on features extraction \\nrequired for fusion.\\n4.1.1. Expression feature extraction\\nIn Instance 1 of our approach, we extract features from the 2 and \\n3 downsampling blocks of the U-Net while generating an expression-\\nconditioned image guided by the prompt 𝑃(𝑒𝑥𝑝) (e.g., ‘‘A photo of a \\nman’s face, expression*’’, where expression represents expressions like \\nhappy or sad), as illustrated in Fig. 3. These blocks progressively cap-\\nture higher-level patterns by aggregating low-level visual features [63,\\n64], and their convolutional layers focus on key dynamic facial re-\\ngions, such as the eyes, mouth, and eyebrows, which are essential for \\nconveying expressions.\\nSimultaneously, these layers minimize the influence of static\\nidentity-specific features, allowing the model to prioritize non-identity \\nInformation Fusion 125 (2026) 103431 \\n4 \\nM.S. Afgan et al.\\nFig. 2. The proposed FaceExpr fine-tuning framework utilizes 3 instances of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models: Instance 1: Expression Guider generates expressive facial \\nimages using prompt 𝑃(𝑒𝑥𝑝), extracting relevant features for guidance. Instance 2: Personalized Expression Generator (PEG) fine-tunes the model using input identity images and \\nprompt 𝑃(𝑖𝑑), incorporating expression features through attention-focused feature fusion along with an expression prompt. Meanwhile, identity preservation loss is applied to retain \\nthe identity, and expression crafting loss to strengthen the feature alignment. In parallel, Instance 3: Context Guider applies prior preservation loss to leverage the semantic \\nprior, ensuring diverse instance generation and seamless context integration.\\nFig. 3. Illustration of attention-focused fusion and integrating expression prompt embeddings. The intermediate expression features from Instance 1, 𝑓𝑛\\nexp, along with the identity \\nfeatures from Instance 2, 𝑓𝑛\\nid, are processed separately for each block n through the mutual attention. This results in the fused features 𝑓𝑛\\nfus, corresponding to Blocks, respectively. \\nThe fused features for each block are then integrated independently during the upsampling phase of Instance 2. Additional prompt embedding 𝑃(exp) is added to the identity \\nprompt 𝑃(id) during fine-tuning on a set of identity images 𝐼(𝑥)\\nid .\\nattributes while reducing identity-related details [65,66]. These fea-\\ntures are computed using Eq. (4). \\n𝑓𝑛\\nexp = 𝑋\\n𝑃(𝑒𝑥𝑝)\\n𝑡∈[0.3𝑇,0.7𝑇]\\n(4)\\n𝑓𝑛\\nexp represents the expression features, with 𝑛 indicating the block \\nnumber.

These features are fused using mutual cross-attention, where 𝑓exp\\nserves as the query for the first attention, and 𝑓id serves as both the \\nkey and value. Conversely, for the second attention, 𝑓id serves as the \\nquery, while 𝑓exp is used as both the key and value. The outputs of both \\nattention mechanisms are then added together.

The fusion mechanism enables the \\nmodel to learn complex relationships between identity and expression. \\nRather than treating these features separately, the model adapts the \\nidentity features based on the desired expression. Additionally, the \\nattention mechanism processes each block individually. The approach \\nfocuses on preserving identity-related information by retaining only \\nthe essential spatial features for expression alignment while discarding \\nirrelevant features [66].

These features \\nare then passed into the corresponding upsampling blocks of the U-\\nNet via skip connections, denoted as 𝑋skip, ensuring proper alignment. \\nFinally, the model generates the output image 𝐼gen, which incorporates \\nboth the identity and the desired facial expression.\\n4.2.2. Expression prompt embedding\\nIn the above section, our attention-focused fusion mechanism com-\\nbines identity and expression features, resulting in a new expressive \\nfused identity. To establish a direct association between the fused ex-\\npressive identity and the expression token, we combine both prompts at \\ncorresponding time steps. Specifically, the first prompt, 𝑃(𝑖𝑑), contains \\nan identity token, ensuring the generated face retains the subject’s \\nidentity. The second prompt, 𝑃(𝑒𝑥𝑝), specifies the desired expression \\ntoken. The combination is as follows: \\n𝑃(𝑖𝑑) + 𝑃(𝑒𝑥𝑝)\\n(7)\\nThis combination occurs during both the downsampling and upsam-\\npling blocks of the model, where feature extraction and fusion take \\nplace. Rather than concatenating 𝑃(𝑒𝑥𝑝) and 𝑃(𝑖𝑑), we adopt an additive \\nfusion approach, similar to [46], enabling multiple conditioning inputs \\nto blend smoothly. Given that CLIP provides 768-dimensional embed-\\ndings and Stable Diffusion is designed to process inputs of the 768-\\ndimensionality, concatenation would yield a 1536-dimensional vector, \\nrequiring unnecessary structural changes. By contrast, addition pre-\\nserves the original model architecture, ensuring efficient processing. \\nMoreover, as both prompts describe the same type of subject class \\n(e.g., a man or a woman), adding them reinforces the common identity \\nfeatures and prevents conflicts between the prompts.\\nBy using addition, the model learns the relationship between expres-\\nsive fused identity and expression token, ensuring that the generated \\nimage reflects both the subject’s facial features and the intended ex-\\npression. Upon receiving a specific expression token in the prompt, the \\nmodel synthesizes the desired expression while enhancing its intensity, \\nall while retaining the identity of the individual.\\n4.3. Instance 3: Context guider\\nTo effectively integrate context, we adopt a strategy similar to [32], \\nincorporating prior preservation loss with class-specific images gener-\\nated by instance 3. This helps the model retain the core knowledge \\nof the subject class (e.g., generating images of a specific subject, \\nlike a man/woman) even when fine-tuned on a particular individual. \\nApplying the prior preservation loss to the expression-inclusive images \\nensures that both the subject’s identity and facial expression are pre-\\nserved. This process enables the model to handle diverse environmental \\ncontexts such as changes in scenes or lighting without losing the \\nsubject’s identity or expression (shown in Fig. 2).\\n4.4. Fine-tuning and objective function\\nIn Instance 2, the main instance of the framework, we employ mul-\\ntiple loss functions to ensure both identity preservation and accurate \\nexpression generation.\\nIdentity Preservation Loss employed Perceptual loss (\\ue238percep) is \\nused to preserve the identity by comparing high-level feature extracted \\nby employing the VGG16 [67] pre-trained model.

𝑁 refers to the number of features.\\nPrior Preservation Loss (\\ue238prior) is introduced to preserve the \\nmodel’s ability to generate diverse outputs and prevent overfitting \\nduring fine-tuning. This loss helps the model retain its generalization \\nInformation Fusion 125 (2026) 103431 \\n7 \\nM.S. Afgan et al.\\ncapabilities by ensuring that fine-tuning does not overly bias the model \\ntowards the specific subject. It is defined as: \\n\\ue238prior = E𝑥∼𝑝class\\n[\\n‖𝑓𝜃(𝑥) −𝑓𝜃pre(𝑥)‖2]\\n(11)\\nwhere 𝑓𝜃 represents the fine-tuned model, 𝑓𝜃pre represents the pre-\\ntrained model, and 𝑝class is the distribution of class prior images.\\nTo manage the combination of prompts and establish a coherent \\nconnection, the optimization is formulated as: \\nmin\\n𝜆1∶𝑇\\n[\\n\\ue238clip\\n(\\n𝑿(𝑒𝑥𝑝)\\nexp , 𝑿(𝜆)\\ngen, 𝑃(𝑒𝑥𝑝), 𝑃(𝑖𝑑)\\n)]\\n(12)\\nwhere \\ue238clip measures how well the generated image 𝑿(𝜆)\\ngen matches the \\nexpression image 𝑿(𝑒𝑥𝑝)\\nexp , given the influence of both prompts 𝑃(𝑒𝑥𝑜) and \\n𝑃(𝑖𝑑).\\nOverall Loss: The total objective function combines these losses to \\nensure both identity preservation, expression accuracy, and the model’s \\ngeneralization. The total loss is given as: \\n𝐿total = 𝛼\\ue238percep + 𝛽\\ue238cosine + 𝛾\\ue238rec + 𝛿\\ue238prior + 𝜂\\ue238clip\\n(13)\\nwhere 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛾, 𝛿, and 𝜂 are the weights assigned to each loss.\\n5. Implementation, experimental setup, and results\\nThis section demonstrates our proposed methodology’s implemen-\\ntation, experimental setup, and results.\\n5.1. Implementation\\nWe utilize the pre-trained weights of the ‘‘stable-diffusion-xl-base-\\n1.0’’ model, publicly available through Hugging Face,1 due to its state-\\nof-the-art performance in image generation. The model generates 10 \\nfacial images for each expression in Instance 1, while extracting fea-\\ntures from key Block 2 (640 × 32 × 32) and Block 3 (1280 × 16 × 16). \\nWith a total of 40 steps, the features are extracted from time steps \\nranging from 0.7T to 0.3T, resulting in 16 total steps. For each set of 10 \\nimages, the extracted features total 160 for each block. The generated \\nimages, along with their corresponding features, are saved for later use \\nin the fusion mechanism.\\nUsing the same pre-trained model weights, we fine-tune the model \\nwith DDPM [22] over 400 timesteps. The schedule is split into 280 \\nsteps at 0.7T and 120 at 0.3T, totaling 400 steps. This process is \\nrepeated for each facial expression, and losses are calculated based \\non each expression’s reference images. We set the weights for the loss \\nfunctions as follows: 𝛼= 0.55 for identity preservation, 𝛽= 0.3 for \\nexpression accuracy, 𝛾= 0.05 for reconstruction quality, 𝛿= 0.05\\nfor prior preservation, and 𝜂= 0.05 for the clip loss. To prevent \\ncatastrophic forgetting during sequential fine-tuning, we employ mem-\\nory replay [68], periodically reusing previously generated images to \\npreserve the knowledge of earlier expressions.\\n5.2. Experimental setup\\nAll identity images collected from the CelebA-HQ dataset,2 which \\nprovides high-resolution facial images. The subjects are categorized \\ninto men and women. One sample image from each subject’s iden-\\ntity is presented in Fig. 6, with the top row labeled ‘‘Identity’’. The \\nexperimental setup utilized four NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPUs, \\neach equipped with 24 GB of VRAM. The training process for a single \\nidentity takes approximately 3 min. Our method generated images at a \\nresolution of 512 × 512 pixels, requiring only 20 reverse diffusion steps \\nfor sampling [69]. The sampling time is remarkably efficient, taking \\napproximately 1 s per image.\\n1 https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0\\n2 http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html\\n5.3. Fine-grained expression results\\nTo the best of our knowledge, no standalone or hybrid diffusion-\\nbased method in academia or industry has achieved this level of \\nfine-grained expression generation while preserving identity across eth-\\nnicities. Furthermore, no existing facial expression generation hybrid \\nmethods can accurately synthesize diverse expressions for a single \\nidentity, as extreme expressions often compromise identity. In contrast, \\nFaceExpr efficiently handles multiple expressions for a single identity \\nwithout sacrificing identity consistency. Fig. 6 highlights the capability \\nof FaceExpr to generate diverse expressions while maintaining identity \\nconsistency across different ethnic groups. Fig. 7 further demonstrates \\nFaceExpr’s effectiveness in generating accurate expressions across vari-\\nous head orientations, showcasing proficiency in action guidance while \\npreserving both expression and identity. Moreover, Fig. 8 illustrates \\nFaceExpr’s ability to incorporate contextual information, generating \\nfacial expressions that align with different settings, including attributes, \\naccessories, actions, and environments. The model successfully adapts \\nthe generated expressions to the given setting, proving its capability \\nto handle various contexts while preserving the subject’s identity and \\nexpression.\\n6. Comparative evaluation\\nThis section evaluates the proposed approach by comparing it with \\nexisting methods, categorized into standalone (entirely diffusion) and \\nhybrid (relying on external modules) approaches. The evaluation in-\\ncorporates performance metrics, user feedback, and ablation studies to \\nassess the effectiveness of the approach.\\n6.1. Evaluation metrics\\nThe evaluation is performed using five key metrics. Identity Preser-\\nvation (ID.) is assessed using the ArcFace model [52], which measures \\nthe euclidean distance between feature vectors of the original input \\nand generated faces. Values close to 0.5 indicate an exact match, while \\nvalues over 1.0 represent distinct identities, with lower values being \\nbetter. Semantic change (SemChg.) is evaluated using HRNet [70], \\nwhere values near 0.5 indicate minor changes, values closer to 1 reflect \\nmore significant changes, and higher values are preferable. Expression \\naccuracy (Exp.) is assessed using the VGGFace2 model [71] with a \\nResNet-50 backbone, where higher values indicate greater accuracy in \\ngenerating the intended expressions. Fidelity (IQ.) is measured using \\nthe Frechet Inception Distance (FID) [72], where lower values indi-\\ncate better fidelity and a closer alignment to the distribution of real \\nface. Text-to-Image Similarity (CLIP-T.) is evaluated using the CLIP \\nmodel [73] to measure the alignment between generated images and \\ninput text prompts, with higher values indicating stronger alignment. \\nFinally, Image-to-Text Similarity (CLIP-I.) is assessed using the CLIP \\nmodel [74] to evaluate how well the generated images align with \\ntheir textual descriptions, with higher values indicating better align-\\nment. Additionally, we evaluated our method in terms of complexity \\nby comparing the training and inference times, providing a more \\ncomprehensive analysis of FaceExpr.\\n6.2. Comparison with standalone approaches\\nWe compared FaceExpr with five standalone approaches: Textual In-\\nversion [31],3 DreamBooth [32],4 DisenBooth [33],5 Celeb-Basis [37],6 \\nand CIP-TIG [38].7 All methods were implemented to ensure a fair \\ncomparison.\\n3 https://github.com/rinongal/textual_inversion\\n4 https://github.com/XavierXiao/Dreambooth-Stable-Diffusion\\n5 https://github.com/forchchch/DisenBooth\\n6 https://github.com/ygtxr1997/CelebBasis\\n7 https://github.com/lyuPang/CrossInitialization\\nInformation Fusion 125 (2026) 103431 \\n8 \\nM.S.

The images are generated using the prompt: ’a front face photo of a [xyz*] \\nman/woman, {expression*}, where [xyz*] serves as an identity token unique to each individual and {expression*} represents various expression types, such as happy, sad, \\netc. This demonstrates FaceExpr’s proficiency in preserving identity and generating diverse facial expressions across multiple ethnicities.\\nFig. 7.

The face images are generated using the prompt: a \\n{orientation*} face photo of a [asianm1] man, {expression*} where {expression*} represents various expression types, such as happy, sad, etc., and {orientation*} \\nrepresents head action (e.g., front, side).\\nQualitative Comparison: To demonstrate the effectiveness of Face-\\nExpr, Fig. 9 presents visual comparisons with existing methods. For \\nclarity, we focus exclusively on expression prompts to highlight the \\nsemantic changes needed for accurate expression generation. As shown, \\nFaceExpr generates photorealistic personalized images with precise \\ndesired expressions. In contrast, optimization-based methods like Tex-\\ntual Inversion and DreamBooth struggle to modify facial semantics, \\nresulting in little to no change in expressions (e.g., columns 1–2). On \\nthe other hand, methods such as DisenBooth, Celeb-Basis, and CIP-TIG \\nproduce significant changes in facial semantics but compromise iden-\\ntity preservation and face fidelity (e.g., columns 3–5). In comparison, \\nFaceExpr generates personalized images that faithfully preserve both \\nthe identity and desired expression. Additional results in Fig. 11 further \\ndemonstrate FaceExpr’s ability to generate photorealistic images with \\ndiverse expressions, as well as variations in clothing, accessories, global \\nattributes, actions, and environmental settings.\\nQuantitative Comparison: In addition to the qualitative analy-\\nsis, we validate the performance of FaceExpr through a quantitative \\nInformation Fusion 125 (2026) 103431 \\n9 \\nM.S.

The upper section of Table 2 compares FaceExpr with \\nstandalone methods. The results show that FaceExpr outperforms state-\\nof-the-art methods in expression accuracy (Exp.), semantic change \\n(SemChg.), text-to-image (CLIP-T.), and image-to-text (CLIP-I.) align-\\nment. Although FaceExpr does not achieve the highest identity (ID) and \\nimage quality (IQ) scores, this is not a limitation of the model but rather \\na direct result of the semantic modifications necessary for expression \\ngeneration, a point that reflects a fundamental trade-off in this task. \\nIn our approach, image quality (IQ) specifically refers to facial fidelity: \\nthe clarity and realism of identity-relevant facial regions. To synthesize \\nconvincing facial expressions, our model must alter key regions (such \\nas the mouth, eyes, and eyebrows) features that are not only crucial for \\nexpression but also integral to facial identity. These localized structural \\nshifts, while essential for accurate expression generation, partially dis-\\nrupt identity cues in those regions. Consequently, both ID and IQ scores \\nare impacted.\\nIn contrast, methods like DreamBooth achieve higher identity scores \\nby deliberately minimizing semantic changes to these expression-\\ncritical regions. However, this strategy inherently limits their ability \\nto produce expressive, rich images. Thus, the observed trade-off is not \\nincidental; it reflects an intrinsic property of expression-driven image \\ngeneration: the more accurately a model modifies facial structure to \\nrepresent expression, the more it risks altering the underlying identity.\\nIn summary, FaceExpr outperforms all competing standalone meth-\\nods. It achieves a strong balance across metrics: the second-best ID. \\nscore (0.78), the highest SemChg. score (0.69), the best Exp. ac-\\ncuracy (85.25%), and superior text-image alignment (CLIP-T. 0.244;\\nCLIP-I. 0.700).\\n6.3. Comparison with hybrid approaches\\nWe compared FaceExpr with four hybrid approaches: DiffSFSR [39], \\nEmojiDiff [40], W+ Adapter8 [41], and MasterWeaver9 [42]. Due to \\nthe lack of publicly available code for DiffSFSR and EmojiDiff, we \\nre-implemented both methods by closely following the architectural \\nguidelines and methodological details provided in their original papers. \\n8 https://github.com/csxmli2016/w-plus-adapter\\n9 https://github.com/csyxwei/MasterWeaver\\nInformation Fusion 125 (2026) 103431 \\n10 \\nM.S. Afgan et al.\\nFig. 9. Qualitative comparison with standalone methods. Existing approaches often fail to accurately generate the specified facial expressions. In this comparison, we omitted \\nadditional contextual details to focus solely on expression accuracy.\\nWhile certain implementation-specific nuances may be absent, our \\nreproduction aligns with the reported results for a fair comparison. Im-\\nportantly, unlike these hybrid methods, which require a large training \\ndataset and significant computational time for fine-tuning, our Face-\\nExpr framework operates as a standalone diffusion-based model, requir-\\ning no extra datasets and offering substantially lower computational \\ntime.\\nQualitative Comparison: To demonstrate the effectiveness of Face-\\nExpr, Fig. 10 presents visual comparisons with existing hybrid methods. \\nIn this comparison, we focus solely on expression prompts to high-\\nlight the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing facial close-up \\nimages for improved identity visualization. As shown, FaceExpr gen-\\nerates photorealistic personalized images with precise expressions. In \\ncontrast, hybrid methods such as EmojiDiff and DiffSFSR require a \\nreference image to guide the expression (shown in the top-right corner \\nof the generated image). These methods produce notable expression \\nchanges but compromise image fidelity and identity due to the use of \\nadditional learned embeddings (e.g., columns 1–2). Methods like W+ \\nAdapter and MasterWeaver also generate better expression images but \\nstruggle to accurately capture extreme expressions, such as surprise \\nand shock, compromising both identity preservation and face fidelity \\n(e.g., columns 3–4). In comparison, FaceExpr generates personalized \\nimages that preserve identity with the highest fidelity. Additional re-\\nsults in Fig. 11 further demonstrate FaceExpr’s ability to generate \\nphotorealistic images with diverse expressions, as well as variations \\nin clothing, accessories, global attributes, actions, and environmental \\nsettings.\\nQuantitative Comparison: In addition to the qualitative analysis, \\nwe assess the performance of FaceExpr through a quantitative evalu-\\nation. The lower portion of Table 2 presents a comparison between \\nFaceExpr and hybrid approaches. The findings indicate that FaceExpr \\nsurpasses hybrid methods in identity (ID.), image fidelity (IQ.), text-\\nto-image (CLIP-T.), and image-to-text (CLIP-I.) alignment. However, \\nFaceExpr’s expression accuracy (Exp.) and semantic change (SemChg.) \\nscores are not the highest, which can be attributed to the absence \\nof reference images for expression guidance and reliance solely on \\ndiffusion models.\\nIn summary, FaceExpr outperforms all competing hybrid methods, \\nachieving a strong balance across metrics. It delivers the best ID. score \\n(0.78), the second-best SemChg score (0.69), Exp. accuracy (85.25%), \\nand superior image fidelity IQ. score (19.62). Additionally, it excels in \\ntext-image a alignment (CLIP-T. 0.244; CLIP-I. 0.700).\\n6.4. Comparison of computational complexity\\nAdditionally, we conducted a comprehensive comparison of our \\nmethod with others. Regarding training, all methods were implemented \\non the same machine used for FaceExpr to ensure consistency in the \\nevaluation, as detailed in Table 3. Textual Inversion requires 8 min \\nand 1k steps to optimize embeddings for a single identity, DreamBooth \\ntakes 15 min and 800 steps to fine-tune the model for a single identity, \\nDisenbooth demands approximately 70 h and 12k steps, Celeb-Basis \\nneeds 9 min and 800 steps, and CIP-TIG takes around 30 h and 10k \\nsteps. Among the hybrid methods, W+ Adapter requires 120 h and 8k \\nsteps to train, MasterWeaver takes 133 h and 100k steps, EmojiDiff de-\\nmands 60 h and 10k steps, and DiffSFSR requires 130 h and 100k steps. \\nIn contrast, FaceExpr demonstrates exceptional efficiency, requiring\\nonly 3 min and 400 steps for fine-tuning, highlighting a substantial \\nreduction in training time.\\nFor inference, Textual Inversion takes 200 s with 50–100 steps, \\nDreamBooth requires 180 s with 50–100 steps, and Disenbooth de-\\nmands 180 s with 50–100 steps.

User feedback study\\nThis section explains the quantitative analysis presented in Table 4. \\nThe analysis is based on feedback from 89 randomly selected partici-\\npants (51 males, 38 females, aged 18–45). Each participant evaluated \\nimages generated by our FaceExpr alongside various standalone and hy-\\nbrid methods, focusing on four key metrics by answering the following \\nquestions:\\n1. Identity Preservation: Does the generated image resemble the \\nperson in the Original ID image?\\n2. Expression Accuracy: Does the expression in the generated \\nimage match the desired expression?\\n3. Realism: Does the face in the generated image appear natural \\nand lifelike?\\n4. Image Quality: Is the overall generated image (including the \\nface, background, and lighting) clear and well-rendered?\\nStatistical significance was assessed using a 𝑝-value threshold of 0.05. \\nTextual Inversion and DreamBooth were excluded from the study due \\nto expression accuracy falling below 30%.\\nIdentity Preservation: FaceExpr achieves the highest score of 4.50, \\nsignificantly outperforming all other methods.

Ablation study\\nWe structure our evaluation around two analytical perspectives. \\nFirst, the component ablation study isolates the effects of our novel \\nfeature fusion strategy and the integration of the additional prompt \\nembedding. Next, we provide an instance-based evolution analysis built \\nupon our innovative three-instance framework. This analysis traces \\nthe progressive influence of each instance across various evaluation \\nmetrics, examining their individual contributions.\\n6.6.1. Component ablation study\\nIn this subsection of the ablation study, we analyze two key com-\\nponents: the impact of feature fusion and the impact of the expression \\nprompt within the U-Net module. we analyze four time-step feature fu-\\nsion scenarios to assess the impact on identity preservation, expression \\naccuracy, and semantic changes.\\nFeature Fusion Effect: Fig. 12(a) visualizes different fusion strate-\\ngies across four scenarios (each row (1 to 4) corresponds to a specific \\nfusion configuration.), and the left portion of Table 5 provides the \\nimpact of feature fusion on identity preservation, expression accuracy, \\nand semantic change.\\n• Scenario 1: Feature fusion timing significantly influences seman-\\ntic change and identity preservation. When fusion occurs from \\n(T →0T), semantic change is maximized (SemChg = 0.70), lead-\\ning to the highest expression accuracy (Exp = 84.50%) but poor \\nInformation Fusion 125 (2026) 103431 \\n13 \\nM.S. Afgan et al.\\nFig. 12. Ablation study on feature fusion and prompt embeddings across different time steps: (a) Impact of feature fusion, with the fourth scenario (0.7𝑇→0.3𝑇) showing the \\noptimal alignment of expressions and identity. (b) Effect of expression prompt embedding, with the (0.7𝑇→0.3𝑇) interval achieving improved expression accuracy and balanced \\nidentity preservation.\\nTable 5\\nAblation study on attention-based feature fusion and prompt embeddings: Quantitative evaluation \\nof the trade-off between identity preservation and expression accuracy across denoising time steps. \\n \\nFeature Fusion Impact\\nPrompt Embedding Impact\\n \\nTime-step\\nID.↓\\nExp.(%)↑\\nSemChg.↑\\nID.↓\\nExp.(%)↑\\nSemChg.↑ \\n \\nScenario\\nT → 0T\\n1.3\\n84.50\\n0.70\\n0.90\\n85.2\\n0.65\\n \\n \\n0.7T → 0T\\n0.98\\n89.36\\n0.78\\n0.78\\n82.0\\n0.62\\n \\n \\nT → 0.3T\\n1.45\\n86.6\\n0.75\\n0.83\\n89\\n0.90\\n \\n \\n0.7T → 0.3T\\n0.78\\n82.0\\n0.62\\n0.78\\n85.5\\n0.69\\n \\nidentity preservation (ID = 1.3). At early denoising stages (higher \\ntimesteps, closer to 𝑇), the model prioritizes broad structural and \\nsemantic elements, treating expression features as fundamental \\ncomponents rather than modifications to the desired identity. \\nConsequently, identity drift occurs as the model reconstructs an \\nidentity influenced by the extracted expressive features rather \\nthan preserving the original, as shown in the figure, row 1.\\n• Scenario 2: Adjusting fusion to (0.7T →0T) improves identity \\npreservation (ID = 0.98) while achieving strong semantic change \\n(SemChg = 0.78) and expression accuracy (Exp = 89.36%). Here, \\nthe model first establishes identity as a core feature before fusion \\nbegins at 0.7T. As denoising progresses, expression adaptation \\ncompetes with identity retention, requiring a balance between \\nboth, as seen in row 2 of the same figure. Despite strong feature \\nfusion, this setup was not selected due to relatively lower identity \\npreservation.\\n• Scenario 3: Fusion from (T →0.3T) further decreases iden-\\ntity preservation (ID = 1.45), with moderate semantic change \\n(SemChg = 0.75) and reduced expression accuracy (Exp = 86.6%). \\nSimilar to the scenario 1: (T →0T) case, early fusion leads to \\nidentity deviation, as illustrated in row 3 of the figure.\\n• Scenario 4: The most balanced configuration is achieved when \\nfusion is applied from (𝟎.𝟕𝐓→𝟎.𝟑𝐓), yielding optimal semantic \\nchange ( 𝐒𝐞𝐦𝐂𝐡𝐠= 𝟎.𝟔𝟐), good expression accuracy (𝐄𝐱𝐩= 𝟖𝟐.𝟎%), \\nand improved identity preservation (𝐈𝐃= 𝟎.𝟕𝟖). Here, the model \\nfirst establishes identity, then integrates expression features while \\nmaintaining constraints, ultimately refocusing on the desired \\nidentity at 0.3T. This adaptive balance ensures expressive feature \\nalignment without significant identity loss, as demonstrated in \\nrow 4.\\nPrompt Embedding Effect: In this part, we evaluate the impact of \\nintegrating additional prompt embeddings, which aim to establish the \\nconnection between expressive fused identity and expression-specific \\nprompt. Fig. 12(b) presents four different time-step scenarios, with each \\nrow (1 to 4) representing a distinct configuration. The right section \\nof Table 5 quantifies the effects of prompt embedding on identity \\npreservation, expression accuracy, and semantic consistency across \\nthese configurations.\\n• Scenario 1: We first evaluate the impact of embedding prompts \\nacross all time steps (T →0T). The results show a clear trend: \\nIdentity Preservation (ID = 0.90) decreases by 0.12 (worse than \\nthe target ID = 0.78), while Expression Accuracy (Exp = 85.2%) \\nincreases by 3.2% (compared to the target 82.0%), and Semantic \\nChange (SemChg = 0.65) rises by 0.03 (compared to the target \\n0.62). This indicates the strong influence of additional prompt \\nembeddings on the generated face, similar to fusion scenario 1. \\nDuring early denoising, the sample is still noisy, and the model \\ntreats the additional prompt embedding as an intrinsic part of the \\nexternal condition, leading to identity drift (see figure, row 1).\\n• Scenario 2: To mitigate this, we explored the optimal time-step \\nrange that establishes a connection without excessively influenc-\\ning expressive fused identity. Embedding prompts from (0.7T →\\n0T) yielded expected results: identity preservation (ID = 0.78), ex-\\npression intensity (Exp = 82.0%), and semantic change (SemChg =\\n0.62), as shown in figure, row 2.\\n• Scenario 3: Next, we hypothesized that refining the time-step \\nrange could enhance expression intensity without compromising \\nidentity. Embedding prompts from (T →0.3T) resulted in a \\nslight decrease in identity preservation (ID = 0.83, a 0.05 drop \\nfrom the target 0.78), increased semantic change (SemChg =\\n0.90, up by 0.28 from the target 0.62), and improved expression \\naccuracy (Exp = 89.0%, up by 7.0% from the target 82.0%). \\nHowever, identity preservation dropped beyond the acceptable \\nrange, causing a shift in identity, as seen in the figure, row 3.\\n• Scenario 4: To address this, we further explored and embedded \\nprompts from (𝟎.𝟕𝐓→𝟎.𝟑𝐓), achieving a better balance: iden-\\ntity preservation (𝐈𝐃= 𝟎.𝟕𝟖), expression accuracy (𝐄𝐱𝐩= 𝟖𝟓.𝟓%, \\na 𝟑.𝟓% increase), and semantic change (𝐒𝐞𝐦𝐂𝐡𝐠= 𝟎.𝟔𝟗, exceeding \\nthe target by 𝟎.𝟎𝟕). As shown in row 4 of the figure, this configura-\\ntion successfully enhanced expression accuracy while preserving \\nidentity. Among all configurations, the first was ineffective, and \\nthe last provided the best balance between identity preserva-\\ntion and enhanced expression accuracy while establishing the \\nconnection.\\nInformation Fusion 125 (2026) 103431 \\n14 \\nM.S.

Instance-based ablation study\\nBeyond a component-wise ablation, we delve into the behavioral \\ndynamics of each of the three model instances within our innovative \\nFaceExpr framework. Each instance encapsulates a distinct generative \\nbehavior pathway, contributing uniquely to the model’s output charac-\\nteristics. The ablation study, as illustrated in Fig. 13 and quantitatively \\nsummarized in Table 6, demonstrates the cumulative impact of in-\\ntegrating these components. The evaluation spans key performance \\naxes, including identity preservation, semantic change, expression ac-\\ncuracy, contextual-text alignment, and face fidelity. This progressive \\nanalysis reveals how each instance contributes to balancing these often \\ncompeting objectives, offering insights into the internal trade-offs and \\nsynergies that emerge during the generation process.\\nInstance 2 (w/o Fusion & Text Embedding): The model operates \\nwith only Instance 2 (without fusion or textual embedding), and it \\nshows no capability in both expression synthesis and context aware-\\nness. Although identity preservation remains relatively strong (ID score: \\n0.52), the absence of facial expression cues (no expression score avail-\\nable) and minimal semantic alteration (SemChg: 0.32) demonstrates the \\nmodel’s inability to deviate meaningfully from the input identity. Ad-\\nditionally, the low CLIP-Text alignment score (CLIP-T: 0.128) indicates \\nthat the generated images lack semantic coherence with the intended \\ntextual prompts related to context. While face fidelity (IQ: 19.20) is \\nrelatively good due to minimal visual change, it reflects the lack of \\nmeaningful transformation in the facial semantics, not the successful \\ngeneration of desired expression (See row 1).\\nInstance 2 (w/o Fusion & Text Embedding) + Instance 3: This \\nconfiguration incorporates Instance 3 without leveraging fusion or text \\nembeddings. While identity preservation remains the same (ID: 0.52), \\nthe model exhibits almost no semantic change (SemChg: 0.30), indicat-\\ning no adaptability to expression or attribute modifications. Although \\nCLIP-Text alignment increases to 0.223, implying enhanced consistency \\nwith the prompt (See row 2).\\nInstance 2 (w/ Fusion & Text Embedding) + Instance 1: In-\\ntroducing feature fusion and text embeddings in this configuration \\nsignificantly boosts the model’s ability to generate meaningful expres-\\nsions (Exp.: 87.77) and improves semantic shift (SemChg: 0.72). These \\nenhancements, however, come at the cost of identity preservation, \\nwhich drops to 0.78. This trade-off is expected and can be attributed \\nto the nature of facial expression changes, which inherently alter \\ncertain identity-linked features such as muscle movement and localized \\nstructure. Face fidelity (IQ: 20.17) also slightly degraded, reflecting the \\nvisual complexity introduced by more expressive outputs. Importantly, \\nthe decrease in CLIP-Text alignment (CLIP-T: 0.137) can be attributed \\nto a lack of context (See row 3).\\nInstance 2 + Instance 1 + Instance 3 (w/ Prior Preservation):\\nThe full framework configuration, which incorporates all Instances, \\nachieves the most balanced performance. Identity preservation (ID) \\nremains consistent with a score of 0.78, while expression accuracy \\n(Exp.) reaches 85.25 and semantic shift (SemChg) registers at 0.69, \\nboth reflecting slight reductions. This modest decline is attributed to \\nthe regularizing effect of the prior preservation loss, which counteracts \\nthe distributional shift caused by fine-tuning and pulls the model \\ncloser to the original distribution. Notably, CLIP-T alignment reaches its \\nhighest value of 0.244, indicating a stronger correspondence between \\nthe generated images and textual prompts due to better alignment in \\nboth context and expression. Furthermore, face fidelity (IQ) improves \\nwith a score of 19.62, which suggests that prior preservation effectively \\nmitigates visual degradation while preserving fine facial details (See \\nrow 4).\\nDiscussion Behind the Three-Instance Design: The three-instance \\ndesign plays a pivotal role in optimizing the performance and spe-\\ncialization of our model by clearly segmenting each task into distinct \\nInformation Fusion 125 (2026) 103431 \\n15 \\nM.S. Afgan et al.\\ncomponents. Each instance is tailored to handle a specific responsibil-\\nity, ensuring that the model remains efficient and prevents overfitting. \\nInstance 1 focuses on feature extraction and generating multiple diverse \\nexpressions along with corresponding features, providing the base for \\nfurther processing. Instance 2 is responsible for fine-tuning, allow-\\ning the model to specialize in generating specific expressions without \\ncompromising facial identity. This separation ensures that identity \\ndiversity is maintained while facilitating high-quality expression gen-\\neration. Instance 3 introduces prior preservation, acting as a safeguard \\nagainst catastrophic forgetting, which ensures the model retains crucial \\nknowledge from its base training. This division not only minimizes \\ntask conflicts but also enhances the model’s robustness and ability to \\ngeneralize, especially when handling unseen prompts.\\n7. Conclusion and future directions\\nIn this paper, we proposed the FaceExpr an innovative three-\\ninstance framework, based on a person-specific fine-tune approach that \\nemploys only a diffusion model for generating user-defined human \\nfacial expressions with customizable diverse settings, offering enhanced \\ncontrol for achieving personalization. To accomplish this, we introduce \\na unique and exceptionally novel feature fusion with an attention-\\nbased mechanism, along with the integration of additional expression \\ntext embeddings into the U-Net denoising module. FaceExpr effec-\\ntively aligns identity and expression features, while the inclusion of \\nexpression crafting loss ensures seamless blending of identity with ac-\\ncurate expression. Extensive experiments demonstrated that FaceExpr \\nachieves 90%–95% identity preservation and 84–86.5% expression ac-\\ncuracy across diverse ethnic groups, outperforming existing standalone \\nand hybrid methods. This highlights its potential for personalized con-\\ntent generation in digital storytelling, immersive virtual worlds, and \\nresearch applications.\\nFuture work could extend FaceExpr to control full-body attributes, \\nenabling more comprehensive personalization for a wide range of \\napplications. These advancements would improve the generation of \\nhigh-quality, customizable human datasets, advancing research in areas \\nlike person re-identification and face recognition.\\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\\nMuhammad Sher Afgan: Writing – original draft, Visualization, \\nMethodology, Conceptualization.
